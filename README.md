## Overview

Flight price calculation can either use newly scraped data (scrapes upon running it) or cached data that reports a price-change confidence determined by a trained model.


## To Do

- [ ] Scrape data and clean it
- [ ] Testing for scraping
- [ ] Algorithm to check over multiple days and return summary
- [ ] Determine caching method: wait for request and cache? periodically cache?
- [ ] Model for observing change in flight price
	- Predict how much it'll maybe change
- [ ] UI for showing flights that are 'perfect' to constraint / flights that are close to constraints, etc
- [ ] Caching/storing data, uses predictive model to estimate how good this is

## Real Usage

Here are some great flights I was able to find and actually booked when planning my travel/vacations:

- NYC ‚û°Ô∏è AMS (May 9), AMS ‚û°Ô∏è IST (May 12), IST ‚û°Ô∏è NYC (May 23) | Trip Total: $611 as of March 7, 2022
